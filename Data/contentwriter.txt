Subject: Request for Immediate Resolution of the Issue Regarding House Property

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding the issue of house property that has been pending for a long time. Despite my repeated requests, my son, [Son's Name], has failed to provide me with the necessary documentation and information regarding the property.

As you are aware, I am the co-owner of the house property along with my son. However, he has been reluctant to provide me with any information about the property, including the current market value, outstanding loans, and any maintenance or repair work that needs to be done. His constant refusal to share this information has caused me immense stress and anxiety.

Not only has this lack of transparency caused me financial difficulties, but it has also strained our relationship. As his parent, I have a right to know about the property and to be involved in any decisions regarding its management.

I urge you to use your influence to resolve this matter amicably and to ensure that my son provides me with the necessary documentation and information regarding the house property. I would appreciate it if you could also facilitate a meeting between us to discuss this matter and find a resolution.

I hope that you will take immediate action to resolve this issue and restore our relationship to its former cordial state.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
