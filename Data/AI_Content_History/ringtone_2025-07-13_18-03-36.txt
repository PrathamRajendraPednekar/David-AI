Let's create a fun and catchy ringtone together!

Here's a simple melody:

(Drumroll)

Da-da-da-DUM, da-da-da-DUM, da-da-da-DUM, da-da-da-DUM
Ting-ting-ting, ting-ting-ting, ting-ting-ting, ting-ting-ting

For a more complex ringtone, let's add some harmony:

(Drumroll)

Da-da-da-DUM, da-da-da-DUM, da-da-da-DUM, da-da-da-DUM
Ting-ting-ting, ting-ting-ting, ting-ting-ting, ting-ting-ting
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Ri-ri-ri, ri-ri-ri, ri-ri-ri, ri-ri-ri

Feel free to modify the melody to your liking!
